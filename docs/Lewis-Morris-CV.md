My passion is technology; I recently finished a group project creating a Discord music bot which I found very useful in </br>
learning Discord.py and interacting with APIs - this was a first for me. My team and I learned a lot from this, which </br>
we can all apply to future group projects. However, if I were to undertake this again, I would choose discord.js </br>
instead.

A side project I am looking to start soon is creating my website with a JavaScript framework, either React, Vue.js or </br>
another JavaScript framework. I am looking to learn more languages focusing on web development, as this is something </br>
that I find interesting but have yet to explore in much detail. 

The language I am currently learning is Rust which is similar to C in some regards. It is a low-level systems programming </br>
language applicable for critical backend infrastructure. I am teaching myself and using Rust in my final-year project.
